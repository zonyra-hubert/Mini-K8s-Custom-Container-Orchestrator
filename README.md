Mini-K8s: Custom Container Orchestrator
A lightweight, declarative container orchestration system built in Python. This project simulates the core mechanics of Kubernetes, including a Control Plane, Data Plane, Self-Healing, and Dynamic Scaling.

Key Features
Declarative Configuration: Use YAML files to define the desired state of your cluster.

Centralized Master (Control Plane): A Flask-based API that manages the "Source of Truth" for the cluster state.

Autonomous Worker (Data Plane): An agent that interacts with the Docker SDK to manage container lifecycles.

Self-Healing (Reconciliation Loop): A background monitor that detects container failures and automatically restarts them to maintain the desired replica count.

Dynamic Scaling: Scale up or down instantly via CLI without modifying code or manually stopping containers.

Load Balancing & Service Discovery: A Round-Robin Load Balancer that dynamically discovers new replicas and provides a single entry point (Port 80).

 Architecture
The system is composed of four decoupled components:

CLI (orch.py): The user interface for deploying, scaling, and monitoring.

Master (master.py): The "Brain" that stores the desired cluster state.

Worker (worker.py): The "Muscle" that runs the reconciliation loop and talks to Docker.

Load Balancer (lb.py): The "Traffic Cop" that distributes incoming requests across healthy replicas.

🛠 Prerequisites
Python 3.10+

Docker Desktop (must be running)

Virtual Environment (recommended)

Bash
pip install flask docker pyyaml requests
 Getting Started
1. Start the Orchestrator
Open four separate terminals and run the components in order:

Terminal 1: Master

Bash
python master.py

Terminal 2: Worker
Bash
python worker.py

Terminal 3: Load Balancer
Bash
python lb.py
2. Use the CLI

Terminal 4: User Commands
Deploy: Initialize the cluster using a YAML file.

Bash
python orch.py apply deployment.yaml

Status: View the health and replica count of your service.

Bash
python orch.py status

Scale: Change the number of replicas on the fly.
Bash

python orch.py scale 5

 Demonstration of Self-Healing
Deploy 3 replicas: python orch.py apply deployment.yaml

Manually kill a container: docker stop <container_id>

Watch the Worker Terminal: It will detect the "drift" in state and re-spawn a replacement within 10 seconds.

Verify with python orch.py status.
